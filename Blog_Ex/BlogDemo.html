	<h2>Vacation Soaked in Honey and Home Cooking</h2>
	<h5 class="byline">Maxwell Gregg</h5>

	<div class="quote">
		<p>I hadn't seen my friend in a long while 
		<p>But honey never goes bad 
		<p>and when I finally saw her it was popcorn.

		<p>And anticipating smells from the kitchen we embraced for a long time</p>
		<p>I could feel her hair between my arms and her back </p>
		<p>and all I could smell was the chanterelle mushrooms my father would pick on the western slope</p> 
		<p>As an ingredient for risotto</p> 

		<p>We held hands and walked through Boulder.</p> 
		<p>Streets lined with brownies (no not those ones. Real ones. Chocolate brownies with walnuts baked in)</p>

		<p>Her eyes were dark chocolate in color</p>
		<p>but they mixed up feelings in me of summer sangrias and salad made of diced Brussels Sprouts, and nuts, and carrots.</p> 

		<p>She was dressed with a lite homemade vinaigrette, a baggy shirt, and converse</p>
		<p>To preserve the foodie-on-a-budget look</p>
		<p>That she rocked with such careless and aromatic skill that the bananas all turned green again at the sight of her.</p>   

		<p>The street vendors were selling sandwiches and finger foods, and we stopped to taste fresh Italian sausage and illegally old French cheese that smelled like my younger brother coming back from summer camp 
		and tasted like leaving for college</p>

		<p>We sat on a rooftop later, she held my hand and I melted into the chair like a well done brisket and I felt like freshly sliced cilantro working its way into a salad and becoming the main ingredient through guerrilla warfare and shaking maracas.</p> 

		<p>We stare again into each other's eyes and her gaze became my Godfathers mean New Mexico green chili </p>
		<p>The one with the recipe that he'll take to his grave, and just enough heat to make my brother cry</p>
		<p>And would keep me warm on a summer night </p>

		<p>Our tongues burned for a long time after the green</p> 
		<p>and we cooled off, indoors, sitting on her futon. </p>

		<p>The night's flavor resounded with fresh dates, topped with mascarpone, and almonds.</p> 
		<p>Drizzled again with sweet honey.</p>

		<p>When I drove home again the leftovers went bad in my stomach</p>
		<p>and all I wanted to do was u turn and drive back to that warm kitchen I’d just left for the relative equivalent of an outhouse</p>

		<p>But when I texted her again an hour later I discovered that hearty beef keeps for longer than you’d think</p>

		<p>And sweet honey lasts forever.</p>

	<h2>The Role of Imperialism in Archeology</h2>
	<h5 class="byline">Ananya Nuggehalli</h5>

		<p> Our lives are surrounded by the ideas and thoughts of the Ancient Greeks, and many of us forget that there were many great empires, like Ancient Egypt, that were not part of a great European empire. But if the stories of Ancient Egypt are so great then, why did the Europeans try to undermine their influence? It was crucial for Europeans to find their own great ancestors so they could become the center of western civilization and justify imperialism.</p>

		<p>Think about context. We are given a piece of art or music and we build context based off what we can see thus context is influenced by personal biases. Jonathan Culler argued that “context is not given but produced; what belongs to a context is determined by interpretive strategies…the meaning of a context is determined by events” (Bal 175). In some ways, context is a way in which to analyze a piece of work.</p>

		<p>In this paper, I will discuss how the interpretation and importance of the Epitaph of Seikilos (1st Century AD), a musical piece, and the Mycenaean Funerary Mask (1600-1500 BCE), a piece of art, are affected by the era of imperialism in which they were analyzed. The Mask and the Epitaph were functions used to further imperialism by establishing themselves as canonical works.</p>

		<p> The Mycenean Funerary Mask and the Epitaph of Seikilos, which were discovered during the time of vast European imperialism, are considered canonical works because archeologists like Arthur Evans and Heinrich Schliemann used these objects as reasoning of imperialism, and a way to shift the center of western civilization to Europe instead of Egypt.</p>

		<p>The Mycenaean Funerary Mask was found in the Palace of Knossos in 1876 by German archeologist Heinrich Schliemann. This mask was the first known attempt in Europe to render a life sized human face. Schliemann believed it to be the mask of Agamemnon; he claimed that there was a great ancestor that was connected to the European and western culture. For Schliemann, this was proof of the truths to Homer’s Epics. When excavations of Crete began people learned that “Homer’s description of Crete as a land rich in ‘ninety cities’ and ‘men past counting’ may not have been a great exaggeration” (Hitchcock 2). Homer’s epics plus the objects discovered helped the Europeans in proving that their ancestors were these great people, and that their civilization was one of the greatest, which was very important to Europeans because they needed an ancestor that was mightier than those of Egypt to shift the center of western civilization to Europe. Schliemann’s interpretation of the mask and his addition of context from Homer’s works was influenced by Imperialistic sentiments that helped to shift from Egypt to Europe.</p> 

		<p>Arthur Evans was an English scientist and an archeologist who used Schliemann’s discoveries and interpretation to also further imperialism. Evans supported imperialism sentiments by claiming that “Minoan was, above all, an emblem of this people’s differences from the world of the mainland ‘Mycenaeans’” (Hitchcock 2). Because Evans was a scientist many believed what he had to say; especially when “the cosmopolitan source, center, and origin of the civilization whose margins were sung about by Homer” was found (Hitchcock 3). These archeologists saw a connection between these great Epics by Homer; and through this connection they could establish objects such as the Mask as canonical works of art. By establishing these works as canonical works archeologists could, once again, claim that Europe should be the center of western civilization because of how amazing (and ‘accurate’) these stories of Homer were; which is why we still know and hear about Homer’s epics today.</p> 

		<p>The Epitaph of Seikilos, found in 1883 by Scottish archeologist William Ramsay, is another example of the ‘superiority of the western world.’ It is the earliest full piece of music (from 1st Century AD) to be found, and it followed Pythagorean’s philosophy of tempered tuning almost exactly, even though it was created several centuries before tempered tuning even existed. Thus, demonstrating that Europe already had an advanced understanding of music and math. Plato believed that music was a tool “to teach truth and goodness” (Eddy 18). This is key because they had established that the people who created the Epitaph were intellectually advanced; but because the work followed the philosophy of Pythagorean that meant that it also followed Plato’s belief meaning that it was a sophisticated society. This once again helped to create a canonical work since the piece was connected to both Pythagorean and Plato; thus, once again justifying the idea of imperialism. </p>

		<p>Moreover, the discoveries that occurred during the European era of Imperialism were established as canonical works to shift the center of western civilization away from Egypt and to Europe. Both the Mycenean Funerary Mask and the Epitaph of Seikilos are examples of canonical works that helped that shift. This shift to European culture is still found in our lives today. For example, our architecture mimics that of Classical Greece and we all know great philosophers from Europe because our ideologies remain the same. For example, Pythagorean is taught in a high school geometry class as the Pythagorean Theorem. The Mycenean Funerary Mask and the Epitaph of Seikilos were found during an era of European Imperialism, which is why they were established as canonical works.</p>
